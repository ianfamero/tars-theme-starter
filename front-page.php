        <p>Hi there! I'm a WordPress starter theme made with Tars CSS. There is nothing much you can see for now as I was built with as little design as possible to give you the freedom to make modifications however you want. There are a lot of CSS classes that you can re-use so don't forget to check them out before writing your own so as not to "re-invent the wheel" as they say.</p>
        <p>I have a very useful and easy to use mobile-first grid system, as well as some very beautiful animations that you can implement with your design. My margins and paddings are set to zero (nada) to give you the freedom to adjust them to suit your needs. </p>
        <p>Also, I'm 100% built with SASS so you can enjoy using things like variables, mixins, etc. to make your development process much easier and quicker.</p>
        <p>Good luck on your WordPress theme development journey!</p>
